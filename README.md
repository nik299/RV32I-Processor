# RV32I-Processor
My learning of how to implement a RISC-V processor in verilog 

This Git repo is of my files which buildup at the end to be a processor.This is done as a part of computer organization course so a objective README.md file will be uploaded for every assignment.This can also(hopefully maybe) double as general outline of that folder  


note there will some code which is not optimized
